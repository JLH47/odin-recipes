        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Clam chowder is especially tasty when it's served with a sprinkle of fresh thyme, bacon crumbles and crispy oyster crackers on top. If you like your chowder on the thick side, add another tablespoon of flour after it is done in the pressure cooker. â€”Taste of Home Test Kitchen        </p>
