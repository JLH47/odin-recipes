        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This is a full guide on how to make proper British Fish and Chips using an amber ale beer batter, triple cooking chunky chips (easier than you think), the best mushy peas and a tartar sauce from scratch. This is a real show stopper which will absolutely blow people away, the problem is, it blows most fish and chip shops away too. There is nothing quite like deep frying your own fish and your own chips.
