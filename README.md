My Odin HTML project: Recipes

This html recipes website is to demonstrate that I have grasped the basics of html language and the git workflow.

In this website, I will:
- Make an index page w/ image for three recipes that I'm going to do
- Three individual recipes on their own pages w/ images
- and more...
